# Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive toolset for evaluating the Insertion Sort and Merge Sort algorithms. The Python script, `evaluate_algorithms.py`, serves as a versatile tool for the following tasks:

- **Test Case Generation:** The script generates diverse test cases for different input sizes, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the sorting algorithms.

- **Correctness Verification:** After sorting the generated test cases using C++ implementations of Insertion Sort (`insertion_sort.cpp`) and Merge Sort (`merge_sort.cpp`), the script checks the correctness of the sorting algorithms.

- **Performance Visualization:** Matplotlib is utilized to visualize the runtime performance of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort for various input sizes, providing a clear comparison.

# Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gyanratan-code/comparison_sorting.git

# Visualizing Results

The `evaluate_algorithms.py` script uses Matplotlib to visualize the runtime results of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. The script plots a comparison graph based on the collected data, helping users to interpret the efficiency of the sorting algorithms for different input sizes.

To visualize the results:

1. **Install Matplotlib:**

   Ensure you have Matplotlib installed. If not, run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
